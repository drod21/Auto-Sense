## Tech Stack

### Mobile App
- **React Native** with Expo
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **React Navigation** for routing (Stack + Bottom Tabs)
- **React Native Paper** for Material Design components
- **TanStack Query** for API data management
- **Expo Document Picker** for file uploads

### Backend
- **Express.js** with TypeScript
- **OpenAI API** for spreadsheet parsing
- **In-memory storage** (can be swapped for PostgreSQL)
- **CORS enabled** for mobile access

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Expo Go app on your phone ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent))
- Replit account (for backend hosting)

### Running the App

#### 1. Start the Backend Server

The Express backend needs to be running for the mobile app to function:

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

This starts the API server on port 5000. The backend will be accessible at your Replit URL (e.g., `https://your-repl.repl.co`).

#### 2. Update API Configuration

Open `mobile/lib/api.ts` and update the `API_BASE_URL` with your Replit backend URL:

\`\`\`typescript
const API_BASE_URL = __DEV__ 
  ? 'https://your-repl-name.username.repl.co' // Replace with your Replit URL
  : 'https://YOUR_PRODUCTION_URL.com';
\`\`\`

#### 3. Start the Expo Development Server

In a new terminal (or Replit Shell), run:

\`\`\`bash
npx expo start
\`\`\`

This will start the Metro bundler and display a QR code.

#### 4. Connect Your Phone

1. Open the **Expo Go** app on your phone
2. Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal
3. Wait for the app to load

**Note**: Your phone and computer must be on the same network, or you can use the "Tunnel" mode in Expo for remote connections.

## API Endpoints

The mobile app communicates with the following backend endpoints:

- `GET /api/programs` - List all programs
- `GET /api/programs/:id` - Get program details with phases and workouts
- `POST /api/programs/upload` - Upload and parse workout spreadsheet
- `DELETE /api/programs/:id` - Delete a program
- `GET /api/workout-days/:id` - Get workout day with exercises

## Environment Variables

### Backend (already configured in Replit)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key (provided by Replit integration)
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL` - OpenAI base URL (provided by Replit integration)
- `OPENAI_MODEL` - Model to use (default: gpt-4o)

### Mobile App
No environment variables needed for development. Update `API_BASE_URL` in `mobile/lib/api.ts` directly.

## Deployment

### Backend
The backend is deployed on Replit automatically. Ensure your workflow is running:

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

### Mobile App

**Option 1: Development Build**
1. Install Expo Go on your device
2. Run `npx expo start`
3. Scan QR code with Expo Go

**Option 2: Production Build**
1. Run `npx expo build:android` or `npx expo build:ios`
2. Follow Expo's build service instructions
3. Deploy to Google Play Store / Apple App Store

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot connect to backend
- Ensure the backend is running (`npm run dev`)
- Check that `API_BASE_URL` in `mobile/lib/api.ts` is correct
- Verify CORS is enabled in `server/index.ts`
- Try using tunnel mode: `npx expo start --tunnel`

### File upload not working
- Make sure the backend supports the file size (10MB limit)
- Check that the file format is supported (CSV, XLSX, XLS)
- Verify OpenAI integration is set up in Replit

### App won't load in Expo Go
- Clear Expo cache: `npx expo start -c`
- Restart Metro bundler
- Check for TypeScript errors: `npm run check`
